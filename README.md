<h1>Event Ticketing System</h1>

This application has been developed in order to assist our local swing dance society (Huntsville Swing Dance Society) with their admissions and records.  When I was brought onto the board in February of 2016 I immediately noticed that everything was being done on paper, so I decided to make a web application that would assist with storing our data as well as provide an admissions platform that could be used at the door to keep track of entry sales. <br />

Currently the system is coded for the Huntsville Swing Dance Society, but I am working to develop it into a scalable application to be used by other organizations.  The system is built using Django as the backend and the Django templating language using Ajax calls on the front end.
